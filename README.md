# This repo will contain the HTML implementation of the Atari game Asteroids

This game will be written by Dakota Turk and Harrison Walker

## Controls

The controls of the game will likely be very simple. A brief example:

W - Accelerate forward
A - Deccelerate, move backward?
S - Turn Left
D - Turn Right
[K, O, P]? - Shoot
(Space, J]? - Hyperspace jump

We do not claim to own this game or any of its intellectual property (if any) we simply are making this game for our Computer Graphics course.

## Goals

The goal of the game is pretty straight forward. The player is a small triangular space ship that flies around space avoiding fast and slow moving asteroids. Not only this but some times another, hostile, space ship may spawn and attempt to kill the player too.

In order to evade the asteroids and space ships, the player can shoot them down with their built on cannon or jump into hyper space and attempt a dodge.
